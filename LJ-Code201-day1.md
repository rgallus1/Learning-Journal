<h1>'\'#LJ Code 201 - Day1'</h1>
<p> Well, where do I begin.  I think the biggest challenge is to learn the tools.
For example, Atom, Git, Canvas etc..  It's just a lot to
I must remember that I use Atom to write my html.  I can now see how that works in the browser
since I am able to right click now and open directly into my browser without having to go to
the command line.   Some of the Unix commands we reviewed today were:
pwd
cd
ls
cd ..
mkdir
touch
etc.  
Have submitted my lab exercise.  will need to finish my reading.  Thanks for the help today.
that's all for today!!!!</p>
