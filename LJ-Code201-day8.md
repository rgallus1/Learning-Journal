<h1>Day 8</h1>

<p> Well here i am on day 8 and I am trying to fix my Learning-Journal git issue.  I found a repository inside another repository.  The parent repository had all my files in it.  The child repository didn't have my files it it so I
did an rm -rf to get rid of it.  I'm hoping that once I save this I can git push origin master and these will load correctly.  I can just hope.

This last lab was really brutal.  I need to review everything that we learned this week to really ingest it and ensure I am clear on how things work.  I really need to look at the table and pushing and rendering.....  I just need some time which there seems too little of.  I'd like to actually have dinner with my family and a conversation would be nice rather than a short chat.  

Wish me luck with my git pust origin master.....
