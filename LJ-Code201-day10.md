<h1>Day 10 Learning-Journal <h1>
Today I finished my salmon cookies pages.  I liked this part, although learning to use css is going to take a bit of time.  It was fun though.  I also started
my wireframe today.  The work that I did in code pen did not equal what I saw
when I opened it in my browser so that was really difficult.  I had some issues
that I couldn't figure out.  Hopefully tomorrow will clear that up...  

Notes for Deployment.
Once your master branch has the version of the code you want to deploy, just create a gh-pages branch and push it.
1. `git checkout -b gh-pages`
2. `git push origin gh-pages`
3.  copy this link to canvas.
