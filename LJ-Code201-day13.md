<h1>Day 13</h1>

Time has sure flown by.  I realized on Monday that I actually knew some things.
I am focused on 'catching-up' on my projects, continue working in the labs this week and starting review for the test this weekend.  There is just so much material to review...

It was really good practice today to work with the partners.

I know the local storage exercise today will come in handy with the projects next week.  I'm really looking forward to that.
